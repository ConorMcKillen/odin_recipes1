<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian dish originating from Rome.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>200g spaghetti</li>
    <li>100g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>50g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
    <li>50g Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, add a splash of olive oil. Once hot, add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until it becomes crispy.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic cloves to the skillet, letting them infuse the oil for a couple of minutes until they become golden. Remove and discard the garlic.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, both cheeses, and a generous pinch of black pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss to coat in the pancetta fat.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is still hot, quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over it. Toss vigorously to combine, using some of the reserved pasta water if needed to make a creamy sauce.</li>
