<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An Irish culinary gem, the spice bag is the ultimate late-night takeaway.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes, cut into fries</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 red chillies, finely sliced (adjust based on spice preference)</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by heating the oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>While the oil heats, in a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with half of the paprika, cumin, Chinese five-spice, salt, and pepper. Mix well, ensuring each piece is coated with the spices.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces, frying until they are golden and crispy. Remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same oil, fry the potato fries until they're golden and crispy. Once done, remove and set them aside with the chicken.</li>
        <li>In the remaining oil, saut√© the garlic, onions, bell peppers, and chillies until they're soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the fried chicken and chips back into the wok or pan. Sprinkle over the remaining spices and toss everything together, ensuring the chicken and chips are well-coated with the spices and the vegetables are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, ideally with some dipping sauces on the side, like sweet chili sauce or garlic mayo.</li>
